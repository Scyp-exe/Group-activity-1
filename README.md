<h1>Group Activity 1: Virtual Information Treasure Hunt</h1>
<h6>Click "View raw" within each lab to download labs.</h6>
This group activity was to pretty much get everyone familiar with the "Penn State Libary." Since this is my 4th semester, I already knew how to navigate the websources to find the information needed. To see that all three of us ended up with different items was interesting. We at some point seen the source that others used but each of us found something else more interesting.

<h6>The core information of the activity:</h6>

    Introduction and Treasure Hunt Scenario 
        You are "information detectives" on a virtual treasure hunt to find valuable pieces of information.

    Treasure Hunt Instructions (5 minutes)
        Use the PSU Library to locate a scholarly article "discussing the impact of information overload on decision-making."

    Individual Research (10 minutes)
        Each participant will independently conduct research using the library databases to find the assigned information.

    Collaborative Deliverable (5 minutes)
        Work with your group to compile the findings into a shared online document in Microsoft One Drive [see the people tab to find your 'Treasure Hunt' group]. 
        Each participant should contribute their discovered source [APA citation style] and a brief summary of the information they found.

    Review and Reflection (5 minutes)
        Review each other's findings and engage in discussions about the quality and relevance of the sources. [This is not part of the deliverable]
